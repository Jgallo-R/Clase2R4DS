Otherwise, we're confronted with the challenge that I encounter on a daily basis that in the absence of a clear vision, strategy, business planning, resource allocation and operational support to ensure data focused initiatives actually succeed, the working level folks who do have the skill sets have to manage up. In many cases, it's working level data professionals who actually provide the leadership, vision and innovations for corporate initiatives, and the leadership are at best an impediment to the work, and at worst actively sabotage the initiative through their lack of data competence and literacy.

Transportation and Infrastructure,Data professionals,"Data silos! High level data within our Ministry is stored and managed in a multitude of programs and data formats making access to data very challenging. The majority of data users are at the Region and District level, however datasets are managed at the HQ level making users feel removed from the process of data transformation. As a result, data collected and input into the systems is incomplete, incorrect, and not often quality checked which leads to poor decision making at higher levels where information is used. Data management needs to be brought down to the Regional levels at the least to ensure coordination with data users to make the data input and review systems functional for them, in turn creating better awareness of data processes and better data input and quality overall.

Users need access to all data sources through one portal to be able to compare all available data when making important decisions and to save time (and money).
Users need access to HISTORICAL datasets so that they know what has already been done on their project sites.

The key data related challenge I face is being able to efficiently capture, manage, and deliver important data by relying on under-resourced government IT branches and associated contractors. We have little in-house control over our own data and simple fixes take weeks or months to correct, which literally take minutes to tweak. In my opinion this is a highly inefficient use of resources.

Health,Business users,"When data is presented/found/mined, it often has a historical context that is not shown - ie the purpose the original staff conceived of as the reason for requiring the data, and how it connects to their assumptions/environment/deliverables at the time. 

Along the way, other ideas/contexts/requirements are designed, and sometimes data stops being pulled and ultimately forgotten, or gets entered in a different way in different locations due to lack of historical knowledge/larger understanding of a data set (or that it exists) as roles and tasks get hived off or moved around to different staff/branches/divisions. 

Moreover, any manuals or training materials that exist often describe ""how"" to do the work, but not the ""why"" we do the work (ie this feeds into a larger data set that is used by these professionals at this point in their jobs on the ground). 

It would be beneficial to have a hover-able explanation for each data entry point, and data result point, built into our data providing context and original purposes for the data and why it was deemed necessary/valuable.
